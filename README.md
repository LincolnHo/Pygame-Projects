## COD-Bat Company
Stationary platform shooter that increases in difficulties the more bats the player shoots down.

## CityNinja
A Doodle Jump-esque challenge with acrobatic elements and exciting arts.

## TDShooter
A Top-down shooter project that was cut short due to engine limitations with animating stacked graphics/sprites.

## RoyaltyFreed
A runaway king destined to save the world from its corrupting evil. Storyline is 100% finished but game is really broken.
